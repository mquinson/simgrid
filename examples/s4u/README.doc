S4U (Simgrid for you) is the next interface of SimGrid, expected to be released with SimGrid 4.0.

Even if it is not completely rock stable yet, it may well already fit
your needs. You are welcome to try it and report any interface
glitches that you see. Be however warned that the interface may change
until its final release.  You will have to adapt your code on the way.

This file follows the Doxygen syntax to be included in the
documentation, but it should remain readable directly.

@section s4u_ex_basics Basics of SimGrid simulation

  - <b>Creating actors:</b> @ref examples/s4u/actor-create/s4u-actor-create.cpp and 
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-create/s4u-actor-create_d.xml \n
    Shows how to start your actors to populate your simulation.

  - <b>Ping Pong</b>: @ref examples/s4u/app-pingpong/s4u-app-pingpong.c\n
   It's hard to think of a simpler example: it is just sending one message back and forth.
   The tesh file laying in the directory show how to start the simulator binary, highlighting how to pass options to 
   the simulators (as detailed in Section \ref options). 

  - <b>Token ring:</b> @ref examples/s4u/app-token-ring/s4u-app-token-ring.cpp \n
    Shows how to implement a classical communication pattern, where a token is exchanged along a ring to reach every
    participant.

  - <b>Master Workers:</b> @ref examples/s4u/app-masterworker/s4u-app-masterworker.cpp \n
    Another good old example, where one Master process has a bunch of task to dispatch to a set of several Worker 
    processes. 
    
@section msg_ex_async Asynchronous communications

 - <b>Basic asynchronous communications</b>. 
   @ref examples/s4u/async-wait/s4u-async-wait.cpp \n
   Illustrates how to have non-blocking communications, that are
   communications running in the background leaving the process free
   to do something else during their completion. The main functions
   involved are @ref simgrid::s4u::Comm::put_async and 
   @ref simgrid::s4u::Comm::wait().

 - <b>Waiting for all communications in a set</b>.
   @ref examples/s4u/async-waitall/s4u-async-waitall.cpp\n
   The @ref simgrid::s4u::Comm::wait_all() function is useful when you want to block
   until all activities in a given set have completed.

 - <b>Waiting for the first completed communication in a set</b>.
   @ref examples/s4u/async-waitany/s4u-async-waitany.cpp\n
   The @ref simgrid::s4u::Comm::wait_any() function is useful when you want to block
   until one activity of the set completes, no matter which terminates
   first. 

 @section msg_ex_process Acting on Processes

  - <b>Creating processes</b>. 
    @ref examples/s4u/process-create/s4u-process-create.cpp \n
    Most processes are started from the deployment XML file.    

@section s4u_ex_actors Acting on Actors

  - <b>Creating actors</b>. 
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-create/s4u-actor-create.cpp \n
    Most actors are started from the deployment XML file, but they exist other methods.

  - <b>Daemonize actors</b>
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-daemon/s4u-actor-daemon.cpp \n
    Some actors may be intended to simulate daemons that run in background. This example show how to transform a regular
    actor into a daemon that will be automatically killed once the simulation is over. 

  - <b>Suspend and Resume actors</b>.
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-suspend/s4u-actor-suspend.cpp \n
    Actors can be suspended and resumed during their executions
    thanks to the @ref suspend and @ref resume methods.

  - <b>Kill actors</b>.
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-kill/s4u-actor-kill.cpp \n
    Actors can forcefully stop other actors with the @ref kill method.

  - <b>Migrating Actors</b>.
    @ref examples/s4u/actor-migration/s4u-actor-migration.cpp \n
    Actors can move or be moved from a host to another with the @ref migrate method.

@section s4u_ex_synchro Inter-Actor Synchronization 

 - <b>Mutex: </b> @ref examples/s4u/mutex/s4u-mutex.cpp \n
   Shows how to use simgrid::s4u::Mutex synchronization objects.

@section s4u_ex_actions Following Workload Traces

This section details how to run trace-driven simulations. It is very
handy when you want to test an algorithm or protocol that only react
to external events. For example, many P2P protocols react to user
requests, but do nothing if there is no such event.

In such situations, you should write your protocol in C++, and separate
the workload that you want to play onto your protocol in a separate
text file. Declare a function handling each type of the events in your
trace, register them using @ref xbt_replay_action_register in your
main, and then run the simulation.

Then, you can either have one trace file containing all your events,
or a file per simulated process: the former may be easier to work
with, but the second is more efficient on very large traces. Check
also the tesh files in the example directories for details.

  - <b>Communication replay</b>.
    @ref examples/s4u/actions-comm/s4u-actions-comm.cpp \n
    Presents a set of event handlers reproducing classical communication
    primitives (asynchronous send/receive at the moment).

  - <b>I/O replay</b>.
    @ref examples/s4u/actions-storage/s4u-actions-storage.cpp \n
    Presents a set of event handlers reproducing classical I/O
    primitives (open, read, close).
