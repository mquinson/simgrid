/** @brief Simulation Agent
 *
 * An actor may be defined as a code executing in a location (host).
 *
 * All actors should be started from the XML deployment file (using the @link{s4u::Engine::loadDeployment()}),
 * even if you can also start new actors directly.
 * Separating the deployment in the XML from the logic in the code is a good habit as it makes your simulation easier
 * to adapt to new settings.
 *
 * The code that you define for a given actor should be placed in the main method that is virtual.
 * For example, a Worker actor should be declared as follows:
 *
 * \verbatim
 * #include "s4u/actor.hpp"
 *
 * class Worker : simgrid::s4u::Actor {
 *
 *     int main(int argc, char **argv) {
 *    printf("Hello s4u");
 *    }
 * };
 * \endverbatim
 *
