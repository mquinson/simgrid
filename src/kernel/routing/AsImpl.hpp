   * @brief Probe the routing path between two points
   *
   * The networking model uses this function when creating a communication
   * to retrieve both the list of links that the create communication will use,
   * and the summed latency that these links represent.
   *
   * The network could recompute the latency by itself from the list, but it would
   * require an additional link set traversal. This operation being on the critical
   * path of SimGrid, the routing computes the latency in behalf of the network.
   *
   * Things are rather complex here because we have to find the path from ASes to ASes, and within each.
   * In addition, the different ASes may use differing routing models.
   * Some ASes may be routed in full, others may have only some connection information and use a shortest path on top of that, and so on.
   * Some ASes may even not have any predefined links and use only coordinate information to compute the latency.
   *
   * So, the path is constructed recursively, with each traversed AS adding its information to the set.
   * The algorithm for that is explained in http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00650233/
   *
   * @param src Initial point of the routing path
   * @param dst Final point of the routing path
   * @param into Container into which the traversed links should be pushed
   * @param latency Accumulator in which the latencies should be added (caller must set it to 0)
