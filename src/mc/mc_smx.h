/** @file
 *  @brief (Cross-process, MCer/MCed) Access to SMX structures
 *
 *  We copy some C data structure from the MCed process in the MCer process.
 *  This is implemented by:
 *
 *   - `model_checker->process.smx_process_infos`
 *      (copy of `simix_global->process_list`);
 *
 *   - `model_checker->process.smx_old_process_infos`
 *      (copy of `simix_global->process_to_destroy`);
 *
 *   - `model_checker->hostnames`.
 *
 * The process lists are currently refreshed each time MCed code is executed.
 * We don't try to give a persistent MCer address for a given MCed process.
 * For this reason, a MCer simgrid::mc::Process* is currently not reusable after
 * MCed code.
