\subsection inside_release_c_source Building the source archive

First, clean up your git repository. Some files are included through
globbing, you must ensure that your tree contains no cruft. You can
either checkout a new tree or remove anything from your current tree:
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ git reset --hard master # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
$ git clean -dfx          # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
\endverbatim

You can then build the archive. This gives you your archive in the
build dir, named 'SimGrid-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz'.

\verbatim
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_postchecks Check list after releasing
